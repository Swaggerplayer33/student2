Using post, get, and delete requests, this task system is functional. The model code above is for defining read, update, and create methods, establishing the SQL database, and initialization of the database with three example tasks under the variables t1 and t2 and t3. The list of tasks is iterated through and added to the established database. \n",

This is an important step, since this is the stage of actually setting up the database and its parameters. We are able to add these to the database by running ./migrate.sh, which migrates the data. In this code, we also use db.session.rollback in the case that there is an error creating a task. This is basically like saying nevermind, I want to revert changes. \n",

To break it down, a get request is a request sent to load the contents of a page when a user first opens it up. A post method is also defined, which is a request sent to the backend to add something to the data collection type set up. A PUT (update) request is sent to the backend to update the order of the tasks in the database. A delete request is also sent to the backend because there it deletes the task from the database. In Flask, the _CRUD class defines methods for handling POST, DELETE, PUT and GET requests, with each method corresponding to the respective HTTP method. Flask's routing mechanism directs requests to the appropriate method based on the HTTP method used, allowing for clear separation of logic for creating and retrieving reviews at the specified endpoint.\n",
