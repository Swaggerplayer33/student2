    "The first step to this was to get all of the correct imports. We imported blueprints, requests, and the car model itself. There are quite a few more imports but these ar ethe most important. Next, we established our car_api as a blueprint and added a url prefix. This basically made sure that when we opened our website, we could add /api/car, and it would show us our list of cars. This API took heavy inspiration from the jokes api that was provided by Mr. Mortenson. Next, we extracted the attributes of cars that we defined in the model, so that this data would be fetchable from the front end. Then we established a car object with each of the attributes defined. We added an error message here in case one of the cars did not have the right attributes defined. Finally, we added a get method in order t oretrieve data from the car database (initCars). The final step was to return the JSON response, which was done with a return message. "
