This week, we worked on our team test, and we finished it!

We followed the agile methodology in order to help us work effieciently. By assigning roles to each person, we split the assignment into multiple parts. In order to facilitate communication, we used a group chat in slack and discord.
We also held each other accountable for work by implementing a strike system. In this system, if somebody doesnt do their work, they get kicked out of our group chat for one week. This way, that person will not be able to get help.
